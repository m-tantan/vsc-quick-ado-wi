# Create a Work Item Using Right-Click

In addition to the Command Palette, you can create work items using the **right-click context menu**.

## Steps to Create a Work Item via Right-Click

### 1. Select Code

Just like before, **select some code** in your editor.

### 2. Right-Click on the Selection

Right-click (or use your context menu key) on the selected code.

### 3. Choose "Create Azure DevOps Work Item"

In the context menu that appears, look for **"Create Azure DevOps Work Item"** and click it.

You'll find this option in the same menu group as Cut, Copy, and Paste operations.

### 4. Complete the Prompts

The same prompts will appear as with the Command Palette method:
1. **Enter a title** for the work item
2. **Add optional context/description**

### 5. Done!

The work item is created with all the same features and the URL is copied to your clipboard.

## Which Method Should You Use?

Both methods are equivalent! Choose whichever you prefer:

- **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`): Great for keyboard-centric workflows
- **Right-Click Context Menu**: Convenient when already using your mouse

**Keyboard Tip**: The context menu can also be opened using **`Shift+F10`** (Windows/Linux) or the context menu key if your keyboard has one.
