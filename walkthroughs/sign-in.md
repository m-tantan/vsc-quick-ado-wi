# Sign in to Azure DevOps

Before you can create work items, you need to **sign in to Azure DevOps** using your Microsoft account.

## How to Sign In

Click the **Sign In** button below to authenticate with Azure DevOps.

The extension uses **VS Code's built-in Microsoft authentication**, which means:

- ✅ **Secure**: Your credentials are stored securely by VS Code
- ✅ **SSO Supported**: If you're already signed in to VS Code with your Microsoft account, authentication is seamless
- ✅ **No PATs Required**: No need to create or manage Personal Access Tokens

## What Happens When You Sign In

1. A browser window will open asking you to sign in with your Microsoft account
2. After signing in, you'll be asked to grant permissions to VS Code
3. Once authorized, the authentication completes automatically

## After Signing In

Once signed in, you'll need to configure your **Azure DevOps organization** and **project** in the next step.

## Verifying Your Sign-In Status

After signing in, you can verify your status by:
- The extension will show a success message with your account name
- You can proceed to configure your organization and project

**Tip**: You can sign out at any time using the **"Quick ADO: Sign Out"** command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`).
